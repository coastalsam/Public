# Dumb project. HOW TO USE:::
//create a new folder anywhere and drag the golds.py file into it
//run the csgo stats viewer program
//find the most recent results file that it produces
//Open the file and delete all information that isnt the  SORTED BY TIME section at the beginning. I know, this is what makes it dumb.
//this gives us a list of all your cases opened in order of when they were opened. 
//save a new copy of the file and title it "results", move the file into your new folder with the gold.py file
//run the gold.py file and it should produce two new text files in the folder, one titled reds and one titled golds.
//open the text files to see some interesting stats about your csgo cases
